# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This was a ruse, I was made to believe I was making a study guide to help me learn. Instead, I was learning about HTML, Javascript, Git, and CSS while making a website at the same time!!

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

## Usage
